
1) try.py :- we use the correlation clustering method to do a clustering and then choose the most important feature from each cluster and then repeated the algorithm as mentioned in pseudo code but this has been done as a powerset method

2) last.py :- instead of iterating through all possible subsets , we used an innovative method where at end of each iteration we compared if the heads of the clustered changed or not. it was very fast


3) project_part2.py :- we used the variable importance plot to calculate the importance of each label and incorporate it with the clusters

4) final.py :- finally divided the set into training and testing set and applied various algorithms on it

output.csv and percentage.csv are the results obtained
