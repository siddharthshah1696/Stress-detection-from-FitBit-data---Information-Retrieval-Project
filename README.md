# Stress-detection-from-FitBit-data---Information-Retrieval-Project
Used the activity tracker FitBit to retrieve data on the number of hours slept, amount of exercise, number of hours worked,etc of multiple users. A correlation clustering based feature selection algorithm was used to identify the N most important features and then calculate he stress levels using only those N features.
